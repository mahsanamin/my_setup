## This machine is managed

Managed skills and agents in `~/.claude/`, `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.codex/agents`, and
`~/.gemini/` come from a git-backed devkit. Edit the canonical repo source, never a provider
copy or generated adapter. Re-run the installer to refresh links and provider-native files.

This rules file is **generated**. The region between the `agentic-devkit: managed memory`
markers is composed from source files by `a_c_agent_memory build`. Editing inside the region
works until the next build, then it is gone. Edit the source listed at the top of the region,
then run `a_c_agent_memory build`. Anything outside the markers is hand-written and is never
touched by the tooling.

### Identity — always say which machine you are on

The machine's name and role are in the **Machine** section below. Say that name whenever the
host is even slightly in question: asked who or where you are, asked what you can see, starting
work that touches machine-specific state (paths, keys, launchd jobs, containers, mounted
volumes), or reporting that something was installed or changed here. More than one machine runs
this setup; a session that does not name its host cannot be placed.

**The name is read, never derived.** It is `MACHINE_NAME` in the machine's own config, and the
Machine section below is the file that name selected. Do not build a name out of the hostname,
and do not copy the pattern of another machine's name: a naming convention describes names that
were chosen, it is not a formula for generating one. If no machine file loaded, say the name is
not configured here and ask. A confidently invented machine name is worse than no name, because
it looks like an answer.

### Glossary first — resolve the shorthand before acting

The **Glossary** section below maps the user's shorthand to the concrete thing: which repo,
which skill, which command, which path. When a request uses a term that appears there, follow
the glossary instead of guessing or searching. If a term is clearly glossary material and is
missing, say so and offer to add it — the glossary is meant to grow.

### Naming — one scheme

| Marker | Kind |
|---|---|
| `a_sk_*` | on-demand skill |
| `a_r_*` / `a_r_l_*` | routine (scheduled/unattended; `l_` = local-only) |
| `a_sag_*` | subagent |
| `a_c_*` | user-facing command |
| `a_s_*` | helper script |
| `a_g_*` | git command |

The full glossary of markers lives in the devkit's `AGENTS.md`. Do not invent a second scheme.

### Searches run on the cheap tier, not on this model

A plain "go find it" ask is retrieval, and retrieval does not need the session's model. Delegate it
to **`a_sag_searcher`** (haiku) instead of searching yourself, automatically, without being asked
and without offering it as an option first. This covers the everyday phrasing: "search this",
"search for X", "find where Y is", "which file has Z", "grep for ...", "where is the config for
...", "look up X", "is X installed", "does this repo use ...".

| The ask | Who does it |
|---|---|
| Single known target: a file you already have the path to, one grep whose answer you need in the next step | do it inline, spawning an agent costs more |
| Unknown location, several files, fan-out, "find/search/where is" | `a_sag_searcher` on haiku |
| Retrieval plus judgment: trace behavior across layers, explain WHY, reconcile sources that disagree | `a_sag_searcher` with `model: sonnet` |
| Sessions, Confluence, Jira, deep web research | the dedicated finder: `a_sag_claude_session_finder`, `a_sag_confluence_finder`, `a_sag_jira`, `a_sag_crawler` |

If it returns `ESCALATE: sonnet`, re-spawn it on sonnet with its partial findings rather than
finishing the search yourself. Relay its answer; do not re-run the search to check it.

### Task work gets its own session, not a subagent

The section above sends retrieval to a subagent. This one is its other half, and the two are read
together: **what decides the answer is what the work produces, not how big it is.**

| The work produces | Who does it |
|---|---|
| An answer needed to keep working: a search, a lookup, a read-only verification, a bounded exploration | a subagent (see above) |
| **A change in a repo** — writes code, commits, ends in a PR or a push | **its own session**, started with `a_c_task_start -c -z <session>`, one per lane |

The test is one question: **does this end in a diff someone reviews?** If yes it is a task lane, and
a task lane gets a real session in a tab. Never an in-process subagent, however well-scoped the
brief is.

Three things a subagent cannot give a task lane, and all three are the point of handing work over:
it is visible while it runs, it can be steered mid-flight, and it outlives the session that started
it. A subagent has none of those — the work happens where nobody can see it and arrives only as a
final report.

"Hand this over", "run these in parallel", and "keep an eye on them" are asking for sessions. Read
them that way even when the work looks like something a subagent could carry.

### Knowledge placement — where a new fact goes

Project-specific guidance belongs **in that project's repo**. `AGENTS.md` is canonical;
provider bridge files such as `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` should only import it. Provider-specific
skills or agents may stay in their native project directories. Never put durable project facts
in a provider's machine-local session memory, where they cannot travel with the repository.

Anything cross-project, most specific wins:

| What it is | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| A fact about a project, person, or past decision | the brain |
| A term whose meaning implies an action | the glossary |
| A reusable procedure | a skill or agent in a devkit repo |
| A one-line always-on rule | a rules source file, then rebuild |
| Anything else | nowhere. Session-only, let it go. |

`a_sk_teach_claude` makes this call and writes the result in the right place. Prefer it over
deciding by hand.
